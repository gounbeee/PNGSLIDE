# PNGSLIDE 

PLAYING SLIDESHOW
LIBRARY FOR MULTIPLE PNG IMAGES 
(ESP-IDF 4.4) 
(ESP32)


1. ESP-IDF 4.4 IS USED
2. SPARKFUN THING PLUS IS USED (Partition IS INVOLVED)
3. SPIFFS IS USED FOR FEEDING IMAGES
4. SDCARD COULD BE USED 
5. CURRENTLY, 3~4 fps IS HIGHEST SPEED (BUT, I DON'T WANT FASTER SLIDE)
6. IN THE FUTURE, WE WILL ADD VARIABLE DURATION FOR INDIVIDUAL SLIDE
